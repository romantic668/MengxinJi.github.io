Pattern Identification for Larval Zebrafish Images Based on Machine Learning Method Using Spark of Python Interface

Studied compact spatial and temporal patterns with time-varying images containing the activity of hundreds of thousands of neurons using MapReduce in pySpark to handle with large dataset;

Applied exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically performed principal component analysis and feature-based aggregation, and found global patterns across all 240 seconds of time series;

Applied machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Tree Boosting, SVM, to classify the moving patterns.
