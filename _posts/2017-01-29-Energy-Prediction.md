Energy Prediction of Peaking Power Plant in California Sep 2016
• Analyzed business challenge about how the power grid operator handle a shortfall in available resources versus
actual demand based on environmental condition data, like temperature, vacuum speed, atmospheric pressure;
• Used ggplot2, dplyr R packages and PySpark in data visualization
• Split data into training, validation, and test sets; adopted cross-validation process for model validation; compared
OLS, ridge regression, and lasso regression, with decision tree and random forest model for accurate prediction;
used gradient descent to train model.
