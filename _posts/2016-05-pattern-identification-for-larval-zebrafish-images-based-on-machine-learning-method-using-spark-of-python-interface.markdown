• Studied compact spatial and temporal patterns with time-varying images containing the activity of hundreds of thousands of neurons using MapReduce in pySpark to handle with large dataset;
• Applied exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically performed principal component analysis and feature-based aggregation, and found global patterns across all 240 seconds of time series;
• Applied machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Tree Boosting, SVM, to classify the moving patterns.
